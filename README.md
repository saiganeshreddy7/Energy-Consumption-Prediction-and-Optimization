# Energy Consumption Prediction and Optimization

This project involves predicting and optimizing energy consumption in smart grids using Python, TensorFlow, and related tools.

## Version 0.1

- Basic data preprocessing
- Simple model training using TensorFlow
- Basic optimization using linear regression
- Flask app for model deployment

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run preprocessing: `python src/data_preprocessing.py`
3. Train the model: `python src/model.py`
4. Run optimization: `python src/optimization.py`
5. Deploy with Flask: `python deployment/app.py`
